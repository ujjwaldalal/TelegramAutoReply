A simple python script to enable auto-reply on your Telegram. You can use it similar to out-of-office mails.

I have used the Telethon module for this as it takes care of doing the heavy job on your part and interacts with the Telegram API.

To install telethon on your system:
    pip3 install telethon
    
You can also read the documentation for telethon here: https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/

For obtaining the API_ID and API_HASH refer the below link:
https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
You only need to fill the Application name and Short name field. It is not necessary to fill the remaining.

To run the script:
python3 /path/to/this/script
Provide the code received on your device and your auto-reply starts.

This is just a basic script, tweak around and add your own features - such as replying only to specific people, custom replies for different people, etc.
